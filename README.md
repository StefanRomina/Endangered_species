# Endangered_species
A mosaic plot about a dataset that includes endangered, critically endangered and vulnerable animals.


The dataset includes more than 200 different animals from five different scientific classes. I took special interest on the largest animal classes represented in the dataset: Mammalia, Aves, and Reptilia and focus on the most critical conservation statuses (critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable).

SKILLS USED: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodel libraries, Web scraping.
